General Comments: There is no .dot files at first, but when you run the program,
                  It will generate .dot files corresponding to each .txt file.

-graph1.txt
a typical graph

-graph2.txt
a graph with all same weigts

-graph3.txt
a graph with a bit more vertices and edges

-graph4.txt
a graph with all possible edges present (not considering self-loops and multi-graphs)

-graph5.txt
a graph that is one big cycle (no any other paths except the cycle)

-graph6.txt
a graph that is a tree (no cycle)

-graph7.txt
a graph with multi-graph (two or more edges between a pair of vertices)

-graph8.txt
a graph with self-loop

-graph9.txt
a graph that is a perfectly balanced binary tree 

-graph10.txt
a graph that is not connect 
(In this case, my program considers that the file is corrupted, 
and thus, it terminates without any output.)
